			<h1>Bizness</h1>
			<p> As usual</p>
			<p>I'm Addicted to stress
				That's the way that I get things done
If I'm not under pressure then I sleep too long
And I hang around like a bum
I think I'm going nowhere and that makes me nervous
Everybody's out to get me but I feel all right
Everybody's out to get me but I feel all right
Everybody's out to get me but I feel all right
Everybody's thinking 'bout me
Its the little things that get you
Its the little things that get you when you weren't paying attention
Its the little things that get you
Its the little things that get you when you weren't paying attention
